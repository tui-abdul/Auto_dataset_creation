The code sets up a ROS2 node for publishing and synchronizing data from two cameras and a LiDAR sensor. It loads camera calibration data from YAML files, subscribes to image and point cloud topics, and synchronizes them using a time filter. The images are undistorted based on the calibration data, and the LiDAR point cloud is transformed. The code also displays the camera images and prepares the point cloud for further processing or visualization with Open3D. Lastly, it saves timestamps and sets up a ROS2 playback process for data from a bag file.
